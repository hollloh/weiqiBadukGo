# Javascript Weiqi/Baduk/Go

---

## Philosophy:
- imitate playing weiqi in-person; this includes:
  - following all basic rules
  - placing stones on the board
  - picking stones up from the board / undoing a move (interpret this as grace for placing a stone incorrectly, illegally or misclicking)
  - ability to pass (essentially unlocking handicap play)
  - keep track of both player's captured stones
- ko:
  - neither player can replicate a previous board-state (this includes super-ko's and cycles)
 
 ## Boards:
 - 19x19
 - 9x9
